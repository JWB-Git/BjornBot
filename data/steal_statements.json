Surprised by my surprising strength for a teddy bear, you gave me just enough time to then run away. Better luck next time!", "Unluckily for you, I polished my Horns recently so when you try and grab me by them, I just slip away. Better luck next time!", "I started talking geordie to you. Surprised by the weird dialect (and the fact that a teddy has just started talking), you run away. Better luck next time!", "I play an Uno Reversal Card! I actually steal you, welcome to the world of Vikings! Better luck next time!", "You grab me, but I start singing the Tyne and Wear Metro Musical (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80Isj9JK1s). Now, with no chance of running away without being noticed. You drop me and retreat. Better luck next time!", "You reach out for me, but like Jordan Pickford (who's from Sunderland) reaching to save a goal, you miss and I escape. Better luck next time!", "You almost catch me, but get distracted when Ant and Dec suddenly walk past. Better luck next time", "You have hold of me, but I show you a Viking meme so funny that you accidentally drop me! Better luck next time"]}
